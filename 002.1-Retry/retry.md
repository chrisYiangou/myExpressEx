Create the basic CRUD (CREATE READ UPDATE DELETE)

Delete - Take in an id and print it out (URL Param)

READ - Take in a URL Query and print it out

Create - Take in a body (using Postman) and then print it out

Update - Take in an id and body and print them both out (either one or both)

20 Mins to do this 

# Responses 

Responses are what the sever sends to the client -- console.log -- res - Response

res.send() --> What we are going to be parsing into app layer is needed 
res.status() --> We will be able to change the HTTP status - By default Express will have a status of 200

# Exercise Continued 

I now want you to go back to the CRUD methods that you created and use
the status() and send() methods to send appropriate messages through to your postman 

//The status and what you send are up to you -- try and use String literal and contunyue to print your id, queries, bodies -- What would you want to base a project on.
